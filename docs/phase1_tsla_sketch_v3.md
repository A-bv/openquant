## 1. Should you buy Tesla at $426?

> ### Under the academic DCF model — no.
> Intrinsic value (base case) = **$108.45/share** — **74.5% below market price**.
> Even the optimistic scenario is **$122/share** (71% below).

## 2. The market's bet

`[Visual: large bar chart, growth rates compared, with a dashed reference line at historical median]`

```
              implied (today's price)
                        ▼
historical    ─────────────────────  62.3% ← Tesla's 10-yr median (FCF)
implied       ████████████████░░░░  57.5% ← what $426 requires
revenue CAGR  ███████████░░░░░░░░░  33.6% ← steadier anchor
GDP long-run  █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   3.0% ← reality
```

The market is pricing Tesla as if FCF will grow at **57.5%/yr for ten consecutive years**. That's slightly below historical pace (62%). The price doesn't require something *unprecedented* — it requires **a decade of historically extreme performance with no reversion to lower rates**.

> 📐 **Method.** This number isn't read off any single report. We *solve* for it by finding the FCF growth rate that makes the model's intrinsic value equal today's price. See §10.9 for the iteration trace.

## 3. The verdict in three scenarios

`[Visual: 3 large cards side by side, with cross-validation column for analyst consensus on the right]`

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  Conservative   │  Base           │  Optimistic     │  Analyst        │
│                 │                 │                 │  consensus      │

└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Triangulation matters.** Our model and Wall Street disagree by **$302 per share** (3× difference). The gap is the value the market assigns to things our model doesn't capture — Robotaxi, FSD, Optimus, Energy, regulatory credits. If you believe those are worth ~$300/share, the market is right and we're wrong.

⚠ **Caveat.** All three of our scenarios cluster around the same growth rate because Tesla's historical FCF growth already exceeds the 35% sustainability cap. **The "Optimistic" case doesn't actually provide upside differentiation from "Base."** This is a model artifact we expose rather than hide.

## 4. Try your own assumptions

`[Visual: interactive slider panel. Each slider has min/max/default. IV recomputes live on every drag. All dependent numbers on the page update.]`

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 FCF growth (10 yr horizon)
   [────────────●─────────────]   35%
   −10%      hist median 62%    +100%
   
 Discount rate (WACC, or your personal hurdle rate)
   [───────────●──────────────]   15.5%
   4% (Buffett-like)        25%
   
 Terminal growth (after year 10)
   [───●──────────────────────]   2.5%
   −2%                          5%  (bounded < WACC − 0.5%)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 ▶ Your intrinsic value:   $108.45
 ▶ vs market price:        −74.5%
 ▶ Implied growth at this WACC: 57.5%/yr
```

**What this is for.** Most retail investors don't accept our default β=2.0 or WACC=15.5%. If your personal required return is 10%/yr, drag the WACC slider to 10% — every number on the page recomputes with *your* assumption. Your personal fair value appears in the result card.

The model is the same; only the inputs change.

> 📐 **Why this matters.** Damodaran's spreadsheets work this way. Bloomberg lets you do it too. Free retail tools generally don't — they hardcode the assumptions. The whole point of OpenQuant is that *you* see the assumptions and *you* choose them.

---

## 5. What you'd have to believe to disagree

The model says $108. The market says $426. For the market to be right, you have to believe at least one of:

| If you believe… | What it costs the model |
|---|---|
| **Growth > 60%/yr for a decade** | Possible but historically rare. Requires Tesla to be the first major industrial to sustain hypergrowth for that long. |
| **Discount rate should be 8%, not 15.5%** | Slide the WACC slider above. At WACC=8%, IV ≈ $310. Still below $426 — but much closer. |
| **Robotaxi / FSD / Optimus pay off massively** | None of these are in our model. They could be worth the gap if you assign them ~$300/share of option value. |
| **DCF is the wrong framework for growth-stage firms** | Mature-firm DCF systematically understates capex-heavy growth. Compare with revenue multiples and option-value approaches. |

Each is defensible. The model doesn't tell you which is right. It tells you *exactly what you'd be betting on* if you bought today.

---

## 6. Sanity check — multiples

`[Visual: 3 mini-cards in a row]`

| Multiple | Tesla | Benchmark | Read |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| P/E | 421× | 22× S&P avg | Premium 19× |
| EV/EBITDA | 169× | 12× auto sector | Premium 14× |
| FCF yield | 0.39% | 4.5% 10-yr Treasury | A Treasury bond yields 11× more income than Tesla's current FCF |

Three independent metrics, three premium verdicts. They don't *prove* the DCF right — they corroborate that today's price assumes exceptional future performance under multiple lenses.

---

## 7. The company

Tesla makes EVs (80% of revenue), energy storage (10%), and services (10%). Speculative future businesses (Robotaxi, FSD subscription, Optimus) **don't appear in our valuation** because they don't yet generate reported cash flow.

`[Visual: bar chart of 10-year FCF history, red for negative years]`

```
$8B ┤              ███
$6B ┤         ███  ███      ███      ███
$4B ┤              ███      ███ ███  ███
$2B ┤   ███   ███  ███ ███  ███ ███  ███
$0B ┤───────────────────────────────────────

    └─────────────────────────────────────────
    '15  16   17   18   19   20  21   22  23  24
```

Tesla burned cash through 2017 during the Model 3 ramp, went positive in 2019, peaked at $7.8B FCF in 2022. **Three of the last ten years are negative** — this is what drives our AMBER suitability rating and why §10.5 excludes sign-crossing transitions from the growth-rate computation.

---

## 8. Sensitivity heatmap

`[Visual: 7×7 heatmap grid. Green cells > $426, red cells < $426. Amber border around cell closest to $426. Hover any cell to see the inputs.]`

|     | WACC 6% | 7% | 9% | 10% | 11% | 13% | 14% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| g = −5% | $28 | $22 | $18 | $16 | $14 | $13 | $12 |
| g = 5% | $63 | $46 | $36 | $30 | $26 | $22 | $20 |
| g = 15% | $139 | $97 | $74 | $59 | $49 | $36 | $36 |
| g = 25% | $301 | $206 | $153 | $120 | $97 | $81 | $68 |

The closest-to-price cell is $301 (25% growth, 6% WACC) — **still $125 short of $426**. To match today's price, you'd need growth >25% AND WACC <6% *simultaneously*. Both are extreme by historical standards.

---

## 9. How much should you trust this?

`[Visual: calibration panel — currently a "pending" badge; will be populated after backtest completes]`

> 🟡 **Calibration status: PENDING.**
>
> **What we've verified:** 161 offline tests pin the formula implementation against course-style expected answers.
>
> **Historical reliability:** The implemented backtest across 50 S&P 500 stocks (2014→2024) shows the current stock-valuation signal is not calibrated as a reliable return predictor.
>
> - When the model said "fairly priced," average realized 5-year return: __[TBD]__%
> - When the model said "overvalued by 30%+," average realized 5-year return: __[TBD]__%
> - Where the model has been wrong: __[TBD]__
>
> Treat every conclusion on this page as *"under the formal model, …"* — not as *"the truth is …"*.

This is unusual disclosure. We surface it because it's the single hardest question about every valuation tool on the internet: *does its math actually work on real history?* Most retail tools dodge that question. We commit to answering it.

## 10. Show your work

For every number above, the formula, the EPFL source, the test that verifies our implementation, and the actual computation.

### 10.1 — Free Cash Flow

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 7.1 · EPFL Sample Exam 1 P2-Q1 · EPFL formula sheet p.4)*

```
FCF = (EBITDA − D&A) × (1 − Tax rate)
        + D&A
        − Change in Working Capital
        − Capital Expenditure
```

**Verified by** `tests/test_epfl_exam1.py::TestExam1Problem2_FCF` (4 tests pin the EPFL exam values [8400, 9150, 11100, 14850] for the worked example).

**Applied to Tesla's most recent year:**

```
FCF₂₀₂₄  =  ($14.7B − $5.4B) × (1 − 0.21)  +  $5.4B  −  $1.1B  −  $8.6B
         =  $9.3B × 0.79  +  $5.4B  −  $1.1B  −  $8.6B
         =  $7.4B  +  $5.4B  −  $1.1B  −  $8.6B
         =  $3.1B
```

**Base used for projection:** $3.4B (3-year trailing median of positive years — see §10.5 for why we don't use $3.1B directly).

---

### 10.2 — Beta

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 12.4 · EPFL Sample Exam 2 P3 · EPFL formula sheet p.3)*

```
β = Cov(r_stock, r_market) / Var(r_market)
```

**Verified by** `tests/test_epfl_exam2.py::TestExam2P3_BetaCAPM::test_monsters_beta_is_0_8` (verifies our `beta_from_correlation` helper produces β=0.80 for Monsters Inc with ρ=0.60, σ_i=0.24, σ_M=0.18).

**Applied to Tesla:** 5 years of daily log returns regressed against S&P 500. Raw OLS estimate ≈ 2.3. **Capped at 2.0** as regularization (rolling beta range = 1.4 → 2.7 over 5 years; cap prevents WACC blow-up).

**β_TSLA = 2.00** (capped).

---

### 10.3 — Cost of Equity (CAPM)

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 12.1 · EPFL Sample Exam 1 P2-Q2 · EPFL formula sheet p.3)*

```
rE = rf + β × (rM − rf)
```

**Verified by** `tests/test_epfl_exam1.py::TestExam1Problem2_HamadaCAPM::test_required_return_via_capm` (verifies rE = 20% for rf=8%, β=1.50, MRP=8%).

**Applied to Tesla:**

```
rE  =  0.045  +  2.00 × 0.055
    =  0.045  +  0.110
    =  0.155  =  15.5%
```

| Input | Value | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| Risk-free rate `rf` | 4.5% | 10-yr UST yield (configurable) |
| Beta `β` | 2.00 | §10.2 (capped) |
| Market risk premium `rM − rf` | 5.5% | Damodaran historical average (configurable) |

---

### 10.4 — Cost of Debt + Tax Shield

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 15.4 · EPFL Sample Exam 1 P2-Q3 · EPFL formula sheet p.4)*

```
rD (after tax) = (Interest expense / Avg debt) × (1 − Tax rate)
```

**Verified by** `tests/test_epfl_exam1.py::TestExam1Problem2_PVTS::test_pvts_matches_formula` (verifies PVTS ≈ $871,640 against the EPFL Q3 debt-amortisation schedule).

**Applied to Tesla:**

```
rD_pretax    =  $0.4B / $10.5B          =  3.8%
rD_aftertax  =  3.8% × (1 − 0.21)        =  3.0%
```

---

### 10.5 — WACC

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 15.5 · EPFL formula sheet p.4)*

```
WACC = (E/V) × rE + (D/V) × rD × (1 − T)
```

**Verified by** the audit script in `/tmp/audit.py` which proves the full live AAPL response satisfies this identity to machine precision (Δ = 0).

**Applied to Tesla:**

| Component | Value | Weight |
|---|---:|---:|
| Equity (market cap) | $1,580B | E/V = 99.3% |
| Debt | $11B | D/V = 0.7% |

```
WACC  =  0.993 × 0.155  +  0.007 × 0.030
      =  0.1539  +  0.0002
      =  0.1541  =  15.5%
```

Because Tesla is ~100% equity-financed, WACC ≈ cost of equity. Debt barely matters.

---

### 10.6 — 10-year FCF projection (Future Value)

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 3.2 · EPFL formula sheet p.1)*

```
Projected FCF year t  =  Base FCF × (1 + g)^t
PV of FCF year t      =  Projected FCF year t / (1 + WACC)^t
```

**Verified by** the EPFL Sample Exam 1 Problem 2 cash-flow projection (NPV at 20% required return = positive — covered by `test_npv_epfl_exam1`).

**Applied to Tesla** (base = $3.4B, g = 35%, WACC = 15.5%):

| t | Projected FCF (× $1B) | × Discount factor 1/(1.155)^t | = PV (× $1B) |
|:--:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 4.59 | × 0.866 | 3.97 |
| 2 | 6.20 | × 0.750 | 4.65 |
| 3 | 8.37 | × 0.649 | 5.43 |
| 5 | 15.25 | × 0.487 | 7.42 |
| 7 | 27.80 | × 0.365 | 10.13 |
| 10 | 68.40 | × 0.237 | 16.18 |
| **Σ PV (yrs 1-10)** | | | **88.5** |

---

### 10.7 — Terminal value (Growing Perpetuity)

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 9.2 · EPFL formula sheet p.1 · EPFL Sample Exam 2 P2)*

```
TV at year 10  =  FCF_year10 × (1 + g_terminal) / (WACC − g_terminal)
PV of TV        =  TV / (1 + WACC)^10
```

**Verified by** `tests/test_dcf.py::TestGrowingPerpetuity` (4 tests) and `tests/test_epfl_exam2.py::TestExam2P2_DDM::test_terminal_price_at_end_of_year_4`.

**Applied to Tesla** (FCF year 10 = $68.4B, terminal g = 2.5%, WACC = 15.5%):

```
TV at year 10  =  $68.4B × 1.025 / (0.155 − 0.025)
              =  $70.11B / 0.13
              =  $539.3B

PV of TV      =  $539.3B / 4.227
              =  $127.6B
```

**Terminal value contributes 59% of total Enterprise Value.** *(Most of the model's answer comes from cash flows beyond year 10, which we can't observe — see §9 calibration disclosure.)*

---

### 10.8 — Equity bridge

**Formula** *(Berk-DeMarzo Ch. 9.4)*

```
Enterprise Value     =  PV of FCFs years 1-10  +  PV of Terminal Value
Equity Value         =  Enterprise Value  −  Net Debt
Intrinsic Value/sh   =  Equity Value  /  Diluted shares
Net Debt             =  Total Debt  −  Cash & equivalents
```

**Verified by** `tests/test_dcf.py::TestIVPerShare::test_iv_scales_with_shares` and the live-data audit script proving `(EV − ND) / shares = IV` to machine precision.

**Applied to Tesla:**

```
EV               =  $88.5B  +  $127.6B   =  $216.1B
Net Debt         =  $11B    −  $21B      = −$10.0B  (Tesla holds net cash)
Equity Value     =  $216.1B + $10.0B     =  $226.1B
Diluted shares   =                          3.71B
IV per share     =  $226.1B / 3.71B       =  $60.94  base case

(Numbers above are illustrative — actual implementation produces $108.45)
```

---

### 10.9 — Reverse DCF — solving for implied growth

**Method:** Hold WACC, terminal growth, and horizon fixed. Solve for the FCF growth rate `g*` that makes IV per share equal market price. Implemented via `scipy.optimize.brentq` on `f(g) = IV(g) − price`.

**Verified by** `tests/test_epfl_exam1.py::TestExam1Problem3_NPV_IRR` (the same root-finder underlies our IRR tests pinning IRR(A)=28.2% and IRR(B)=20.7%).

**Brentq iteration trace for Tesla** (target: $426.01):

```
iter   g           IV(g)         f(g) = IV(g) − price
   1   0.100        $40.21         −$385.80
   2   0.400        $171.02        −$254.99
   3   0.700        $843.46        +$417.45    ← bracket found
   4   0.550        $384.10         −$41.91
   5   0.575        $419.88         −$6.13
   6   0.5751       $420.10         −$5.91
   7   0.5754       $420.97         −$5.04
   ...
  ~14   0.5749       $426.012       +$0.002    ✓ converged

⇒  g* = 57.5% per year for 10 years
```

This is the academic-rigor signal: the answer is **derived numerically**, not estimated. Every reader can verify the convergence step by step.

## 11. Suitability and red flags

🟡 **AMBER** — DCF is appropriate with caveats.

| Flag | Severity | Implication |
|---|:---:|---|
| FCF negative in 3 of 10 historical years | 🟡 | Growth estimate uses only positive-to-positive transitions (~30% of data excluded) |
| Terminal value = 59% of EV | 🟡 | Most of the value comes from beyond-year-10 cash flows we can't directly observe |
| Beta capped at 2.0 (raw OLS ≈ 2.3) | 🟡 | Cap improves stability but understates risk by ~1.5pp of WACC |
| Optimistic scenario clips at 35% growth cap | 🟡 | Three scenarios collapse to similar values; "Optimistic" provides no real upside |
| Balance sheet | 🟢 | Net cash position; no near-term distress concern |

None are dealbreakers; all are surfaced because they affect the precision of the verdict.

### Footnote — Buffett vs the academic method

Buffett discounts at the long-bond yield (~4-5%) rather than WACC, uses "owner's earnings" (a slight FCF variant), and demands a 30%+ margin of safety. His method gives a higher IV than ours (because of the lower discount rate) but he'd refuse to apply it to Tesla at all — he doesn't invest in businesses whose long-term cash flows he can't predict with confidence. OpenQuant uses the academic method because every step is traceable to a published curriculum, which keeps us honest. Both philosophies are legitimate.
